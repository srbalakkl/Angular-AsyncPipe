<!--

The async pipe subscribes to an Observable or Promise
and returns the latest value it has emitted.

When a new value is emitted,
the async pipe marks the component to be checked for changes.

When the component gets destroyed,
the async pipe unsubscribes automatically to avoid potential memory leaks.
